;;solution for 2.16
;;If one of the two elements(called e1) in the operation have
;;considered the elements (r1 and r2 in this case)that also be
;;taken into account by another one(called e2), then the two
;;elements' values vary in the same rate, which means e1's value
;;is lowest when e2's value is lowest, while e1's value is highest
;;when e2's value is highest.
;;Based on the theory above, I think this problem is about keeping
;;record of the elements' considered elements. If the considered
;;elements of the two elements in the operation are identical then
;;rules of operation need to be changed into "lower-bound against
;;lower-bound, upper-bound against upper-bound", not interleave.

;;But this method will only work with situations like AB/(A+B).
;;It won't work with (A + C)/(A + B). It's more about math,
;;so I don't wanna think about it, at least for now.
