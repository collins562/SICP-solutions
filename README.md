# SICP-solutions
My own solutions for SICP.

The tool I used to code is DrRacket, which quite fits the scheme language in the book.

The solutions of some question may not be found in it, because I just have skipped them or I haven't figured it out. So, I will, maybe, update it someday.

BTW: files whose names are not preceded by numbers usually include:
- all the changes asked by the exercises or
- some tests for the exercises.

Any suggestion will be appreciated.
