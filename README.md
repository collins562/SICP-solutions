# SICP-solutions
> My own solutions for SICP.

## Editor
The tool I used to code is DrRacket, which quite fits the scheme language in the book.

## BTW
The solutions of some question may not be found in it, because I just have skipped them or I haven't figured it out. So, I will, maybe, update it someday.

Files whose names are not preceded by numbers usually include:
- all the changes asked by the exercises or
- some tests for the exercises.

## Undone Exercises
- ex-5.51
- ex-5.52

These two require C program language to implement. But I haven't finished the study of C yet.

Any suggestion will be appreciated.
