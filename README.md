## Editor
The tool I used to code is [DrRacket](http://www.neilvandyke.org/racket/sicp/), which quite fits the scheme language in the book.

## BTW
The solutions of some question may not be found in it, because I just have skipped them or I haven't figured it out. So, I will, maybe, update it someday.

Files whose names are not preceded by numbers usually include:
- all the changes asked by the exercises or
- some tests for the exercises.

## Undone Exercises
- ex-5.51
- ex-5.52

These two require C program language to implement. But I haven't finished the study of C yet.

## log
- 5.01 ~ 7.31 : finish almost all the exercises
- 8.26 ~ 9.02 : add, complete or refine answers

Any suggestion will be appreciated.
